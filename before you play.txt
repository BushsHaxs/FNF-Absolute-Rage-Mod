there are some optional modcharts for people who might not like some of the effects on screen while playing the mod,
and i also recommend you go to customize gameplay and move the sick and combo to the side of the screen(you might need to move 
it back on other mods).

due to the rapid character switching, its recommened that you play on an ssd, it does work on a hdd but might lag 
for a second at the start of the song.

also thanks for playing - TheZoroForce240
