if you are wondering how the hell i was able to pull this off then this will explain everything, the main concept of the character switching
is by using a modchart, i have fully documented my modchart for anyone trying to figure out what everything does, i went through each section
of the song and wrote down the curStep of when each character changes, i use a big if statement(in modchart) with each character and sequence in the song
for when they change. the characters offsets have been matched almost perfectly with a "fake" idle animation(apart of the stages of playstate.hx, 
also matching the perfect offsets took a good 10 hours) of the character which has a lower opacity (0.8 i think), this was the biggest limition 
of the mod without heavy modification of the games code, because the character would just dissapear when changing, this however gave it a cool 
looking afterimage kind of thing and fits well with the crazy effects on screen. another thing is the background, just took the ballisitc background from
Vs Whitty mod and edited it in GIMP and layered in the Vs tabi Genocide background, added more of the crack thing from ballistic and added the floating rocks
and background of Vs tricky, since the ballistic background is only 4 frames it didnt take too long, i also had to flip it and match the coordinates in 
the xml file so whitty is on the same side as the effect.
